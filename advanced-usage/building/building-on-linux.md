# üêß Building on Linux

To build NuGlobal on Linux, you must be running a supported distro.

1. Download and install Rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) or from your package manager
2.  Open the terminal, and execute

    ```shell-session
    $ git clone https://github.com/Aptivi/nuglobal
    $ cd nuglobal
    $ make
    ```

You'll find the binaries under the `target` folder.
