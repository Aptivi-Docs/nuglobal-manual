1. Download the tarball file from the latest version from [this page](https://github.com/Aptivi/nuglobal/releases). Make sure to select a tarball that mentions `windows`.
2. Use an archive extracting tool to extract the binaries to any folder you like.
3. Open a command prompt, change the working directory to the folder that contains the binaries (for example, the `cd` command), and execute "`nuglobal.exe`".
